            I'm gonna preface this page by saying I'm not an economist, nor an active Crypto investor. I 
            am not an expert on Cryptocurrency and there are many things I do not know about it. What I do
            know though is what the gaming community has been saying about NFT integration in games.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those of you who have avoided this trend, NFTs (or Non-Fungible Tokens) are essentially a
            digital receipt that stores a token. A token can be many things: a photo, an executible, a video,
            whatever. This receipt verifies ownership of that token, and can be verified on the blockchain. These
            tokens are (allegedly) one-of-a-kind.
        </p>
        <p>
            The thing about Crypto and NFTs as a whole is that they don't really appeal to anyone on the outside. And to 
            those looking at the outside there are so many rug-pull and take the money and run scams that you can't easily
            tell a legitimate NFT business from a scam. For some reason though, many companies of different ages and experience
            are trying to break NFTs into the gaming sphere. My problem stems from, at its core, Game Design as a practice revolves
            around making interactive experiences that appeal to as many people as possible and are as inclusive as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            NFTs, by contrast, are very exclusive by design. They are meant to be owned by one person. This automatically
            conflicts with the core value of Game Design. There is already a fundamental disagreement in philosophies.
