            It's GamesCom season once again, so a bunch of new trailers and news have been dropping all day.
            One surprise piece of news is a new gameplay trailer for NeoWiz's upcoming "Lies of P". I first heard
            about this game about a year ago or so when the name and basic premise was dropped, but it's been very
            quiet ever since then.

            That is until today, where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLWPLgnfmW4" target="_blank">a new trailer dropped</a>
            showing off some gameplay and story elements. This game wears it's Bloodborne inspiration on it's sleeve.
            From the gothic archetecture of the world to the same gritty grey and black color palette.

            This brings me to a question I've heard a bit as an instructor and hobbyist game dev:
            where do your ideas come from? The answer I give isn't very satisfying but is still true.
            Ideas come from everywhere and kind of unexpectidly. I'm a big believer in the notion that 
            "there are no original ideas" just original executions, so my ideas usually come from watching something
            or playing something and thinking "what if this had this mechanic from this thing?" and BOOM! Idea.
            </p>
            <p>
            Keeping a journal or database of your ideas is a great way to store them for later. I use a notion
            page I call the "Game Idea Mine" where I can put half or fully thought out ideas for reference later.
